# DQN-LSTM

The First File:
**1. Code_First-Copy**

This file does not need any changes or modifications. It contains the code I used to clean the datasets and perform EDA, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection etc. I did Standard Scaling initially but found that the results were all outputted without it. With scaling the sharpe ratio just produced 'NaN'.

The Second File:
**2. Code_Second-Colab**

This file is where the model is built and trained, along with the environment. I suspect the problem might be with the way the performance metrics are written, but I am not really sure.

The Third File:
**3. Code Requirements**

I've included the main requirements of the project for your perusal. It contains everything that is needed for the code in the second file. It also contains the formulas for the performance metrics.
